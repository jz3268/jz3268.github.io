Some of these networks resort to using squat space, a term the network operations community uses for large public IPv4 address blocks allocated to organizations but historically never announced to the Internet. While squatting of IP addresses is an open secret, it introduces ethical, legal, and technical problems. In this work we examine billions of traceroutes to identify thousands of organizations squatting. We examine how they are using it and what happened when the US Department of Defense suddenly started announcing what had traditionally been squat space.

It seemingly confirmed the main hypothesis our research had led us to, based on prior observation of data routing: Iran’s architecture of connectivity enables selective censorship of international traffic. This paper examines, through the case of Iran, how states can leverage the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) as a tool of geopolitical control and what are the trade-offs they face. This question raises a methodological question that we also address: how the analysis of BGP can infer and document these strategies of territorialization of cyberspace. The Internet is a network of networks where each network is an autonomous system. Autonomous systems (ASes) are independent administrative entities controlled by a variety of actors such as governments, companies and universities. Their administrators have to agree and communicate on the path followed by packets travelling across the Internet, which is made possible by BGP. Agreements between ASes are often confidential but BGP requires neighbouring ASes to interact with each other in order to coordinate routing through the constant release of connectivity update messages. These messages announce the availability (or withdrawal) of a sequence of ASes that can be followed to reach an IP address prefix. In our study, we inferred the structure of Iran’s connectivity through the capture and analysis of these BGP announcements. We show how the particularities of Iran’s BGP and connectivity structure can enable active measures, such as censorship, both internally and externally throughout the network. We argue that Iran has found a way to reconcile a priori conflicting strategic goals: developing a self-sustaining and resilient domestic Internet, but with tight control at its borders. It thus enables the regime to leverage connectivity as a tool of censorship in the face of social instability and as a tool of regional influence in the context of strategic competition.</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">First Monday</abbr></div> <div id="limonier2021mapping" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Mapping the routes of the Internet for geopolitics: the case of Eastern Ukraine</div> <div class="author">Limonier, Kevin, Douzet, Frédérick, Pétiniaud, Louis, Salamatian, Loqman, and Salamatian, Kave </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>First Monday</em> Feb 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p><em>In this paper, we argue that data routing is of geopolitical significance.

Our results show how Donbass ASes progressively migrated from Ukraine’s cyberspace towards Russia, while still sharing connections with Ukrainian ASes. Donbass cyberspace therefore sits at the interface of Ukraine and Russia but has been relegated to the periphery of both networks; it is marginalized from the Ukrainian network but not fully integrated into the Russian network. These evolutions both reflect and affect ongoing geopolitical power rivalries in the physical world and demonstrate their strategic significance.

Our hypothesis was that BGP could be used for geopolitical reasons in the context of a large-scale crisis, leading to a further fragmentation of the Internet. We focused on the Ukrainian crisis.BGP is a core protocol of cyberspace that connects the tens of thousands of autonomous systems (ASes) that compose the Internet. Based on a 35-year-old technology, this protocol is easy to manipulate to re-route Internet traffic or even to cut off entire regions (BGP hijacks). Our results show actions on BGP implemented right after the 2014 Maidan Revolution, when Russian forces took control of the Crimean Peninsula and started to back separatist forces in Eastern Ukraine. In both cases, Russian authorities and separatist forces modified BGP routes in order to divert the local Internet traffic from continental Ukraine – drawing a kind of "digital frontline" consistent with the military one. The study of Donbass and of the Crimean Peninsula leads to important methodological findings to (1) define and map digital borders at the routing level; (2) analyze the strategies of actors conducting actions via BGP; (3) categorize these strategies, from traffic re-routing to cutting-off entire regions for intelligence or military purposes; and (4) anticipate future uses for BGP manipulations by identifying strategic bottlenecks within the network.</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">Espace Pol</abbr></div> <div id="petiniaud2020role" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Le rôle de la topologie d’Internet dans les territoires en conflit en Ukraine, une approche géopolitique du routage des données</div> <div class="author">Pétiniaud, Louis, and Salamatian, Loqman </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>L’Espace Politique.

They are group of routers interconnected by the same administrative control (Internet Service Providers, Content Providers, companies, public services etc.) that interconnect to each other to form the Internet as a whole. By establishing connection agreements between themselves via the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), ASes allow data to flow from one point to another around the globe. In this article, we aim to understand how the aspect of the routing of data can be decisive in how we consider both the relationship between Internet and territory, and the impact of the structure of the Internet on territorial conflicts. Much literature has addressed the relationship between space and the Internet, both in geography and geopolitics. The increasing digitization of various aspects of society (Bakis, 2013 ; Cattaruzza, 2019) was first accompanied by comments about a paradigm shift of the concepts of geography (Virilio, 1997) or sovereignty (Camilleri, Falk, 1992). The relationship between space and Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) has also been considered under the angle of infrastructures and their territorial integration (Lasserre, 2000) More recently, Beaude (2012) and Loveluck (2015) have shown how the complex interactions between Internet and society, produced alternative forms of space. Increasingly, the many dimensions of the Internet and of digitization are considered a salient feature of the social construction of territories, and therefore of geopolitical conflicts (Douzet, 2014). We draw from this literature to illustrate how the network of Autonomous Systems is linked to territorial conflicts. The behavior of autonomous systems, and in particular their integration within the rest of the network, responds to geopolitical constraints. The choice of an AS’s administrators to connect to some ASes and not others, or the way they design and implement routing policies are subject to commercial, political, geographical and legal decisions. The construction of this topology then alters territories, especially disputed ones, and the power rivalries that apply to it. We show that this network is emblematic of the duality of the Internet between topography and topology. This study aims at understanding the role AS topology can play in the traditional power struggle. By selecting the paths through which data flows, administrators of AS bring out territories and new forms of « power-topology » (Allen, 2011). Our methodology combines elements of geopolitics and technical sciences (Internet measurements, network theory) and is based on quantitative approaches. We use data of interdomain connectivity gathered through BGP monitors that allow us to create graphs showing the interconnections between autonomous systems. We use an empirical approach to read the output graphs on a specific case study: disputed territories in Ukraine. The territories of Donbass and Crimea are ideal case studies in that the dispute over them is rather new, which allow us to observe with detail the changes in the topology of their networks over time. They also represent two different types of disputed territories. While Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation in March 2014, the Donbass region is home to the two self-proclaimed People’s Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, and is actively fighting against the central government of Ukraine with the help of Russia. By looking at the stakeholders of connectivity in these territories and their evolution, we show how the Internet is embedded into dynamics of changing sovereignty. In fact, the technical infrastructures of the Internet highlight a new vector of Russian power. The evolution of the routing topology indicates that Crimea is now fully dependent on Russia to connect to the Internet, and Donbass is following the same path.</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">Espace Pol</abbr></div> <div id="gerard2020rt" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">RT, Sputnik et le mouvement des Gilets jaunes: cartographie des communautés politiques sur Twitter</div> <div class="author">Gérard, Colin, Marotte, Guilhem, and Salamatian, Loqman </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>L’Espace Politique.

This strategy, based on a massive presence on social networks, is at the heart of new power struggles between states. In France, Russian state-funded media RT and Sputnik are thus regularly blamed for their editorial policy, which many political and media actors consider as partial or misleading. The Yellow Vests movement, whose members have been accused of being manipulated by Russia and its media, illustrates this observation. While a growing number of publications has focused on the actors of Russian informational influence and the narratives they deploy (Yablokov, 2015; Audinet, 2018, 2020 ; Hutchings, 2020), the question of the reception and the propagation of content produced by these actors on different networks remain unanswered – mainly because of difficulties in accessing to social network data – despite recent efforts (Fisher, 2020). This article therefore proposes to draw up a mapping of the political communities that disseminate the contents of the international Russian media. This cartography is based on data collected on Twitter during the first months of the Yellow Vests movement. The approach we propose here is inspired by the work published by Gaumont et al. which shows that it is possible, through data from Twitter, and especially retweets, to qualify and quantify the activity of political communities, as well as their evolution and reconfiguration over time (Gaumont et al, 2018). Our methodology to map content published by the Russian media is directly in line with the work of Limonier and Pétiniaud (2018), who focused on a part of the "pro-Russian" community of the French-speaking segment of Twitter, as well as on the way this community relayed the MacronLeaks during the between-two rounds of the French presidential election of 2017. Our results first show that content produced by the Russian state-media are relatively popular across a broad spectrum of the French political landscape, from left-leaning to far-right parties. Then, we observe that Yellow Vest communities are distinguished by their weak presence and dispersal within the graph, which confirm the hypothesis that this movement was not formed and structured on Twitter but on Facebook (Sebbah et al, 2018). If the protest movement has indeed been the subject of a very high volume of publications for several months on Twitter, this platform seems to have been only a media and political soundbox, rather than a space for structuring and organizing the different groups of Yellow Vests.</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">RIPE Labs</abbr></div> <div id="petiniaud2019geopolitics" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Geopolitics of routing</div> <div class="author">Pétiniaud, Louis, and Salamatian, Loqman </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>RIPE Network Coordination Center: https://labs. ripe. net/Members/louis_petiniaud/geopolitics-of-routing</em> Feb 2019 </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">ArXiv</abbr></div> <div id="salamatian2018geometric" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A geometric approach for real-time monitoring of dynamic large scale graphs: AS-level graphs illustrated</div> <div class="author">Salamatian, Loqman, Kaafar, Dali, and Salamatian, Kavé </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.00676</em> Feb 2018 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p><em>The monitoring of large dynamic networks is a major challenge for a wide range of application. The complexity stems from properties of the underlying graphs, in which slight local changes can lead to sizable variations of global properties, e.g., under certain conditions, a single link cut that may be overlooked during monitoring can result in splitting the graph into two disconnected components. Moreover, it is often difficult to determine whether a change will propagate globally or remain local. Traditional graph theory measure such as the centrality or the assortativity of the graph are not satisfying to characterize global properties of the graph. In this paper, we tackle the problem of real-time monitoring of dynamic large scale graphs by developing a geometric approach that leverages notions of geometric curvature and recent development in graph embeddings using Ollivier-Ricci curvature [47]. We illustrate the use of our method by considering the practical case of monitoring dynamic variations of global Internet using topology changes information provided by combining several BGP feeds. In particular, we use our method to detect major events and changes via the geometry of the embedding of the graph. We first adapt the Ricci curvature to characterize the AS level graph. The key idea is to detect changes in between consecutive snapshots and to separate events that result in considerable geometric alterations, from those that remain local. The variations of curvature are evaluated through a set of landmarks as reference points. We develop an anomaly tracking mechanism to detect large variations of curvature that translate into major variations in the geometry of the graph. These changes are then considered as major BGP level events. In a second stage, we describe a mechanism for identifying the network elements responsible for the set of coordinated changes and isolate their geometric implications. We evaluate this system in operational settings and show its performance in real-life scenarios</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Loqman R.
